    <p>I play two different sports, I wrestle and I play football. I will first talk about wrestling. When people think or hear about wrestling most of them think about the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The wrestling that I am talking about Olympic Wrestling. This type of wrestling is people met in the center of the circle and create angles to score on thier opponent. This sports requires you to be both mentaly and physically tough. I like this sport the most becasue it has taught me to manage my weight and how to gameplan on an opponent. I have been in this sport for about 6 years.</p>

    <p>Another sport that I participate in is football. I am pretty sure that you have heard of this sport. This is a sport that reqiures two team of 11 players on offense and defence and try to move an oval ball across a line called the goal line. The players on both team are equiped with shouder pad, a helmet, thigh pads, knee pad, and hip pads. </p>
